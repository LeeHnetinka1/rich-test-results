_Status: Proposed_

The source analysis format represents some findings about source code, such
as static analysis warnings. Each finding indicates a range of text in a source
code file, and optionally includes a suggested change to that code.

_TODO: include bits from note.proto_

__Support by producers__

None yet. We should be able to adapt the Findbugs XML report to this format.

__Support for consumers__

None yet.
