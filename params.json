This includes\r\nstatic analysis tools, compilers, and various flavors of automated tests,\r\nincluding browser and mobile tests.\r\n\r\nSince this format will start out without adoption, we must interoperate with\r\nexisting formats. The xUnit XML format originally created by the Ant Junit\r\ntask is the de-facto industry standard today, so we provide a robust parser\r\nfor it. We intend to add more parsers as we determine that other formats merit\r\nsupport.\r\n","google":"UA-56107261-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
